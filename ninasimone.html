            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Eunice Kathleen Waymon, know more widely as <b>Nina Simone</b> was an American singer, songwriter, musician, and civil rights activist. Her music spanned a broad range of musical styles including classical, jazz, blues, folk, gospel, and pop. The sixth of eight children born to a poor family in Tryon, North Carolina, Simone initially aspired to be a concert pianist. With the help of a few supporters in her hometown, she enrolled in the Juilliard School of Music in New York City. She then applied for a scholarship to study at the prestigious Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, where she was denied admission despite a well-received audition, which she attributed to racial discrimination. Simone recorded more than 40 albums throughout her career.</p>
            
            <br/>
            
            <p>On her debut album for Philips, Nina Simone in Concert (1964), for the first time she addressed racial inequality in the United States in the song "Mississippi Goddam". This was her response to the June 12, 1963, murder of Medgar Evers and the September 15, 1963, bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama that killed four young black girls and partially blinded a fifth. She said that the song was "like throwing ten bullets back at them", becoming one of many other protest songs written by Simone. It was a key moment in her political radicalization. "Old Jim Crow", on the same album, addressed the Jim Crow laws. After "Mississippi Goddam", a civil rights message was the norm in Simone's recordings and became part of her concerts. Simone also performed and spoke at civil rights meetings, such as at the Selma to Montgomery marches. Like Malcolm X, she supported black nationalism and advocated violent revolution rather than Martin Luther King's non-violent approach.</p>
            
            <br/>
            
            <p>In 1993, she settled near Aix-en-Provence in southern France. In the same year, her final album, A Single Woman, was released. She suffered from breast cancer for several years before she died in her sleep at her home in Carry-le-Rouet, Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne.</p>
